# GA-Final-Project

Ideas:

1.  Portfolio
  - I definitely plan to make this/expand on what I already have, I would like to also make one of the other two ideas based on what you think I might be able to do.

2.  Community Dog Walk-Share (needs a better name)
  - I live in a townhome community that is pretty dog friendly.  Therefor there are a lot of people with dogs, including myself.
  - It's sometimes hard to find someone to walk your dog when you go out of town or are maybe home late from work.
  - I was thinking of making a site where people could communicate and help each other out when needed.
  - It doesn't have to be super advanced, but maybe something where people could submit a form through the site of their needs and then it is automatically posted to a calendar on the site?  Not sure how complicated that would be.  I feel like having individual accounts would be too complicated and maybe just have a single user/pw to get into the site.  Then that allows anyone to post just by using their name.
  - Also have a bio section on the people in the neighborhood and their dog(s)

3.  A simple PGP Encryption tool
  - Basically I would have a single page with two text fields.  The first is for readable text and the other is activated by a button to encrypt/decrypt the text.  There would be some algorityhm that encrypts the letters in the readable text by converting it to a number, i.e A=1, B=2, C=3, then applies a formula based on a number input (maybe start easy with a selection between 0-9), then converts it to encrypted text.  So something like "Hello, how are you?" may convert into "Jraap, jpe str upi?"  

  - You send this text to someone via email and whatever input number you used and then they can decrypt it by using the decrypt button which will just reverse the function and turn it back into readable english.  

  - I don't know how hard this will be, but I feel like it will be something cool to add to my portfolio to show my JS skillz.
